The U-Net segmentation model has been enhanced with the incorporation of a Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout layer. By default, the dropout probability is set to 0.5, but one can adjust this value to observe variations in predictions and assess the model's sensitivity. The uncertainty estimation will be updated with using multiple forward passes. For now, this model is a very simplistic version to Quantify the Uncertainty.
